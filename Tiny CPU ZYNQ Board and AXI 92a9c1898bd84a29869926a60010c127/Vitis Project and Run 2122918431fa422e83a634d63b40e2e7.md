# Vitis Project and Run

Create a Hello World application project. Refer to [Alternative: Direct Creation of Vitis Application Project from Vivado Hardware](https://github.com/hajin-kim/FPGA_Tutorial_with_HLS/blob/main/Lab05%20Hello%20World%20with%20Vitis%20and%20Vivado%20d3897032db324f5d9531e5ab0a9af6df/Alternative%20Direct%20Creation%20of%20Vitis%20Application%20P%20c3733968f81641d19b17885f5466a621.md)

Makefile problem again. You may have to fix some Makefiles of the generated platform project. Refer to [Makefile Problem](https://github.com/hajin-kim/FPGA_Tutorial_with_HLS/blob/main/Troubleshootings%20f43673650b7c4eb5b83fa2b7a80452e2/Makefile%20Problem%20b266174a19ec426eba6e8e8b3119c7d0.md) 

You have to edit helloworld.c source file.

- **main.c** at ***materials/vitis application***.
- If you changed project name or component name, then you may have to fix some codes.

All done. Build and then Run.

Compare with the original Tiny CPU analysis. The result is identical. It worked well.
